# FriendFinder

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" web application developed with [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/). The application will take in results from users' answers to 10 questions about activities and their level of interest, then compares their answers with those from other users. After submitting the survey the application will display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. Also, the application will record the information of the new user into the `friends.js` file, so newer users can be matched with them.
